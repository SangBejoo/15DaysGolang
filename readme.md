# Golang 15-Day Intensive (with exercises)

A focused 15-day plan to learn Go using exercises from https://dasarpemrogramangolang.novalagung.com/  
Follow one full day per topic, practice with exercises, and track progress.

## How to use
1. Set up Go on your machine.
2. For each day: read the chapter on the linked site, complete exercises, commit code.
3. Track completed exercises in the checklist below.
4. After 15 days, build a small capstone project combining learned topics.

## Daily plan (15 days)
- Day 1 — Go setup, basics: variables, types, operators (10–15 exercises)
- Day 2 — Control flow: if, switch, loops (10–15 exercises)
- Day 3 — Functions, multiple returns, defer (10–15 exercises)
- Day 4 — Arrays, slices (10–15 exercises)
- Day 5 — Maps, range, common patterns (10–15 exercises)
- Day 6 — Structs, methods, interfaces (10–15 exercises)
- Day 7 — Error handling, custom errors (10–15 exercises)
- Day 8 — Packages, modules, tooling (10–15 exercises)
- Day 9 — Concurrency basics: goroutines, channels (10–15 exercises)
- Day 10 — Concurrency patterns: worker pools, select (10–15 exercises)
- Day 11 — File I/O, JSON encoding/decoding (10–15 exercises)
- Day 12 — HTTP client/server, REST basics (10–15 exercises)
- Day 13 — Database access: SQL, drivers, migrations (10–15 exercises)
- Day 14 — Testing: unit tests, table-driven tests, benchmarks (10–15 exercises)
- Day 15 — Project day: integrate topics into a small REST service (capstone)

## Goals & metrics
- Target: 150\+ exercises completed across 15 days.
- Keep daily commits and notes. Review weak areas after Day 7 and Day 15.
